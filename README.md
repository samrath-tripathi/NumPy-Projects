# Projects
Using underlying linear algebraic mathematics, these projects are coded in Python using NumPy library and MATLAB to demonstrate understanding and ability.
The comments in the code are there to guide mathematical foundations of logic behind our interpretations, while also serving as a tool to convey interpretations of outputed variables and code. As is likely visible, I refrained from using lines of code that streamlined the mathematics behind ideas like Least square regression, orthnormalisation, and SVD. This is not due to my unfamilarity with those commands, rather my wish to build the code with the underlying maths given my interests, as well as highlighting my familarity with these models and their foundations.

side note: For PCA project, Matrix V_t is formed by eigenvectors of covariance A matrix. These had to be orthonormalised by Gram schmidth for SVD to stand if not made clear.
