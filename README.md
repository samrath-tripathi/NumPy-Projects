# NumPy-Projects
Using underlying linear algebraic mathematics, these projects are coded in Python using the NumPy library to demonstrate understanding and ability
The comments in the code are there to guide mathematical foundations of logic behind our interpretations, while also serving as a method to convey interpretations of outputed variables and code.
